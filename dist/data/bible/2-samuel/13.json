And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom\u2019s sister.", "5": "<sup>5</sup> And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.", "6": "<sup>6</sup> So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.", "7": "<sup>7</sup> Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon\u2019s house, and dress him meat.", "8": "<sup>8</sup> So Tamar went to her brother Amnon\u2019s house; and he was laid down.
