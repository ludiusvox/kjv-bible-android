{"1": "<sup>1</sup> The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,", "2": "<sup>2</sup> Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:", "3": "<sup>3</sup> And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.", "4": "<sup>4</sup> And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters.
